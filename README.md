## About The Project

### Issues
Attempted to use Google Maps API to find clinicians by state. I was successful.
The problem is the Google API cost. I reached my API limit after 3 refreshes. Although
the real app is on the `master` branch, if you want to run the app using Geocoder, run the command.

```sh
   git checkout geocoder
   ```
